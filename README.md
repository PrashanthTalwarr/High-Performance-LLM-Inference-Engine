Enhanced Problem Statement with CUDA Kernel Focus
"Traditional LLM inference suffers from high latency due to inefficient attention mechanisms. I built a high-performance inference engine with custom CUDA kernels that reduced inference latency by up to 2.34x. The project required low-level GPU programming, including optimized memory access patterns, shared memory utilization, and warp-level parallelism. These raw CUDA kernels demonstrate my ability to work at the hardware interface level for maximum performance optimization, while maintaining integration with higher-level frameworks like PyTorch."
